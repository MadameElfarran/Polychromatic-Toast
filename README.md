# Polychromatic-Toast
A Colorful Minecraft Modpack!

The (P)Toast pack is a semi-minimalistic hand-picked, modular modpack for 1.19.2.

This passion project of mine was born from a desire to make minecraft awesome for me and my friends.

## Features

Balance is a personal goal of mine when it comes to minecraft modding so there's a splash of everything:

* Adventure & world generation additions
  * Mainly _'BYG'_, _'Better Nether'_ & Yung's mods
* Plenty of new mobs from _'Creatures from the Snow'_, _'Naturalist'_, _'Friends & Foes'_ and more
* A splash of tech mods such as  _'YTTR'_ & _'Wired Redstone'_
* Optimisations abound, the modpack is tested frequently to ensure smoother gameplay
  * Easily customisable: check the wiki
* Customise almost every aspect of the game.
  * Accessibility features such as ~colorblind modes~ and view bob tuning.
    * Do note that some of the wiki tutorials require basic knowledge of various scripts

## FAQ

Can I use MultiMC/ATLauncher etc. with this pack?

> I actually recommend a third party launcher because MultiMC allows automatic mod updates which I've setup for this pack. However, make sure you have security software installed on your computer when using unnoffical programs. The last thing I want is for users to be exploited by malicious developers. That is to say, not everyone is evil; **just be cautious!**

Where be thy mod list?

> I giveth to thee: LINK PENDING (However, you must distinguish which mods require what libraries yourself...)

Such an odd name choice, why did ya pick it o' estranged modpack developer?

> *it came to me in a dream...*  
It was actually an idea I had for an item to add to my modded singleplayer world. I like the idea of a piece of toast made of different colors which then inspired me to make this pack. üçû
