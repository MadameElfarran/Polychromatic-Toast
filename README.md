## FAQ

Can I use MultiMC with this pack?

> I actually recommend a third party launcher but make sure you have security software whenever using unnoffical programs. The last thing I want is for users to be exploited by malicious developers.

Such an odd name choice, why did ya pick it o' estranged modpack developer?

> *it came to me in a dream...*  
It was actually an idea I had for an item to add to my modded singlplayer world. I like the idea of a piece of toast made of different colors which then inspired me to make this pack. :p
